/data: contains need probabilities for languages included in the study. Munduruku data is from Pica, 2004.
show_munduruku_fit.py: produces Munduruku figure.
show_need_probability.py: produces need probability graph.
aggregate_complexities_and_costs.py: produces main complexity/cost tradeoff figure. Can swap in different need distributions from data folder.
get_base_n_complexity.py: plot complexities for a range of recursive bases.
