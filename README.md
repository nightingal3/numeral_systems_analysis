This repository contains code needed to replicate the findings in the papers *Numeral systems across languages support efficient communication: From approximate numerosity to recursion*, *Rapid information gain explains cross-linguistic tendencies in numeral ordering*, and *Rapid information gain explains ordering in numeral expressions across languages*.

(They're all related, as you can tell).
