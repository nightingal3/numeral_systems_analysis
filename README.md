Data and code from this repository replicate work in the following publication:

Xu, Y., Liu, E., and Regier, T. (in press) Numeral systems across languages support efficient communication: From approximate numerosity to recursion. Open Mind: Discoveries in Cognitive Science.

Note that code was written/tested in Python 2.7, so some subset may not work in Python 3+.

-/data: contains need probabilities for languages included in the study. Munduruku data is from Pica, 2004.

-show_munduruku_fit.py: produces Munduruku figure.

-show_need_probability.py: produces need probability graph.

-aggregate_complexities_and_costs.py: produces main complexity/cost tradeoff figure. Can swap in different need distributions from data folder.

-get_base_n_complexity.py: plot complexities for a range of recursive bases.
